**Lumberjack:** Durable person slashing his enemies with a heavy axe, good at long-time battles  
**Pirate:** Swift plunderer using a sword and an old pistol, good at quick attacks  
**Musketeer:** Sharpshooter with a musket which has the most damage but reloading takes long time  
**Royal Guard:** Armored guard who has the best defense perks but also the slowest defender role
